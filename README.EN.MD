# Password generator is an indispensable assistant when registering a new account, when you need to come up with a complex password that matches the criteria of the site.

#### Select the structure of the password and its length, and the system will generate an individual sequence of characters for you. It only takes a few clicks from you and the program will help you generate several random strong passwords at once to choose from.

Kaspersky Lab recommends changing the passwords for your e-mail boxes and social media accounts at least once every 2 months. The password generator from *lauendewrau* is a guarantee of reliability and uniqueness, because they are all created only once.

If you leave only "Numbers", then you can use the program as a random number generator.

**To come up with a strong password for an e-mail or social network, you do not need to manually sort through the characters, you just need to set the necessary settings in the generator and get the result.**

__*How does he work:*__

__Choose the types of characters that the password should consist of. It can be any combination of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as%, *,),?, @, #, $, ~. If you do not need some symbols, do not put a tick in front of them .__

**Specify the length of the password. *__The program allows you to create combinations of 1 to 32 characters__*, so it can work as a generator of not only passwords, but also random numbers, unique numbers, and verification codes.**

**Press the button "*Generate*". The program will select a strong password for you.**

##### Search engines *Yandex* and *Google* claim that a relatively strong password has a length of 8 characters or more. In this case, all possible signs must be used in it. It is better to generate a password for VK and other social networks of 8 characters and change it every couple of months than to remember a 12-digit combination, which can still be hacked. Whichever option you choose, my program will pick the right password for you.
